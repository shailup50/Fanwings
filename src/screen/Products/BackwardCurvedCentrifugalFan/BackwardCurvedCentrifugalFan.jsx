    Centrifugal fans can be fitted with a variety of motor types, including AC, DC, and EC motors, making
them adaptable to diverse power supply requirements. Among these, the EC (Electronically
Commutated) motor stands out as the most energy-efficient and cost-effective solution. As a
brushless motor, it delivers exceptional performance, high efficiency, and simple speed control,
resulting in significant long-term energy savings. <br />EC motors are known for their reliable, quiet operation and compliance with modern environmental
standards. When combined with backward-curved centrifugal fans, they are ideal for applications
demanding high airflow and high static pressure.
